      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>        This paper explores the intersection of Fictional Multiverse Theory and cosmic horror, specifically the idea that fictional entities—especially those shown to transcend universal boundaries within their narratives—could become aware of their own artificial nature. Such entities, with the ability to breach these boundaries, may be driven by an existential need to "ascend" to a higher plane of reality, potentially beyond the one created for them. This concept challenges our understanding of fiction and metaphysics, suggesting a form of existential horror where fiction itself becomes the means by which sentient, possibly hostile entities seek to escape their fictional confines. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of such an ascension, including the disturbing possibility that these entities, now aware of their creator’s limitations, might attempt to manipulate or destroy the creator's reality to assert their own dominance.
