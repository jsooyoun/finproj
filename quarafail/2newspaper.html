				Magazine: Thanks for joining us today! Ily Publishing has made quite a name for itself. How did it all begin?
			</p>

			<p>
				Founder: Thanks for having me! Ily Publishing started out of a simple passion for speculative fiction—specifically cosmic horror and science fiction. I was living in a small community, and there wasn’t much focus on these genres locally, so I decided to start publishing them myself. It began as a small operation, really just a way to support a few local authors who shared that same love for the strange and otherworldly.
			</p>

			<p>
				Magazine: It sounds like it was a very personal effort. At what point did you realize that Ily Publishing was starting to attract national attention?

			</p>
			<p>
				Founder: It didn’t take long for me to realize something was shifting. About five or six years ago, these genres—cosmic horror and sci-fi—really started to gain wider popularity for some reason. We were already publishing works in those genres, so when the wider audience began to embrace them, our small press quickly found its place in the conversation. One day, we were getting calls from distributors and media outlets, and I remember thinking, "How did we get here so fast?"

			</p>
			<p>
				Magazine: Ily Media Company is also considered as the progenitor of this current trend of speculative fiction.  What do you think it was about these genres that resonated so strongly with a national audience?

			</p>
			<p>
				Founder: That's hard to say, and to be honest, I don't really know. I don't think its anything we could have predict
