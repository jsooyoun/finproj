Welcome to my Choose your Own Adventure!
When you click on the link below, you will be redirected to the start of the adventure.
Whenever you make a choice, you will be brought to a new home page. Each home page will show two to three different photographs.
Clicking on each photograph will take to a site with additional information.
After visiting all of the sites, return to the home page to make your decision.

There are three different endings you can take. Have fun!
