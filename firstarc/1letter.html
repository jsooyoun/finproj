            My dear friend, <br>
            I fear that the spirits continue to mock me. But, as I perused my shelves for any mere spark of inspiration, I found a strange book I had no collection of ever acquiring.
            <br>I shouldn't have, but I was so desperate - I had been struck by a terrible block in my inspiration for so long, perhaps this was my only chance!
            <br>But I was dismayed when I opened it, for I couldnâ€™t make sense of the text. It was nothing like any language I had ever seen. But, as I sat there, watching it, the words began to shift right before my eyes, until they were in perfect English.
             
            <br>To tell the truth, my friend, I am somewhat frightened. The book feels... off, like it is not entirely of this world.
            <br>But even more than that, I am so, so curious. 
            I have confined it to the furthest edges of my shelves for now, but I do plan to delve further into it. 
            I cannot ignore the pull to learn more, to understand how such a thing is even possible.
            As an author, is it not my duty to unweave and illustrate mysteries such as this?
            <br>
            Sincerely,<br>Arthur Wilford, <br> May 18th, 1983
