          <h2>Incident Description</h2>
          <p>At approximately 2:45 PM, Arthur Wilford was observed causing a public disturbance in the town square, loudly yelling incoherently at passersby. Witnesses reported that his behavior was erratic, with rapid shifts in tone and content, though he did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Despite the chaotic nature of his outbursts, Wilford seemed fully aware of his surroundings and maintained physical control over himself throughout the episode. Local authorities arrived shortly after, and he was escorted to a nearby medical facility for evaluation.
