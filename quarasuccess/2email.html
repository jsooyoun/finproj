                <p> To the Director of the Kos Laboratory,</p>
                <p>I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally notify you of an update to our intelligence regarding the misclassification of Cognitohazard #339, also referred to as the <a href="#" data-text="asdfasdfasdfasd">Wilford Manuscript Infection</a>, that we submitted to your team for investigation. After further review of recent findings from the Ily County Quarantine, we have determined that the document is most likely an instance of autonomous fiction rather than the cognitohazard we initially suspected.</p>
                <p>Thank you for your understanding and continued collaboration. Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you require any additional information or clarification.</p>
                Best regards,<br>
                Deputy Director William Ward<br>
                Paranormal Investigations Unit
